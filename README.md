# Movie system

This application is a basic movie database that makes use of two different APIs: a basic API made by me as well as an API from [TMDB](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs). The user can submit their preferred movies and genres to the database and also submit their own movie reviews. It is also possible for the user to receive lists of their submitted movies, genres and reviews.

## TMDB

This database utilizes TMDBs own discover API. Usage of TMDBs genre IDs is therefore necessary for the TMDB method to work correctly. Some of them may be found [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/talk/5daf6eb0ae36680011d7e6ee).
